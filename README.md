# [Opposite Chess] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Matrix]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Aaron Jacob] - [MBCCET College]
- Member 1: [Amal Baiju] - [MBCCET College]


### Project Description
[Opposite Chess: The Disobedient Edition is a twisted version of classic chess where every move you make happens in the exact opposite direction. Strategy is useless, logic is defied, and your own pieces betray you at every turn. It's the perfect game for those who enjoy chaos, confusion, and a healthy dose of absurdity.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In traditional chess, players rely on logic, strategy, and precise movement to outsmart their opponents. But what if the real problem‚Ä¶ is that it all works too well? Opposite Chess solves this non-existent problem by removing everything that makes chess sensible‚Äîreplacing strategy with sabotage, and obedience with rebellion. It's a solution to a problem no one asked to fix‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs exactly the point.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Introducing Opposite Chess ‚Äî the brilliantly useless answer to a perfectly functional game. It flips every move you make, mocks your intentions, and turns your carefully planned tactics into chaotic backfires. No improvements, no enhancements ‚Äî just pure, unfiltered nonsense. It‚Äôs the solution to nothing, designed for no one‚Ä¶ and it works perfectly at being absolutely pointless.]

You start by clicking on any chess piece on the board ‚Äî it gets selected.
Next, you click on the square where you want it to go.
But surprise! The piece ignores you and moves in the opposite direction instead.
If the opposite square is valid and empty, the move goes through.
If not, nothing happens and the piece just sits there, refusing your command.
